# JS-SIDs-Project

### Project Synopsis: 

To prevent SIDS by using an app to monitor movement, temperature, and breathing patterns. 

### Project Description: 

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death of a baby less than one year old. Thousands of babies die in the U.S. each year without any apparent reason or warning signs. Although there is not a single cause of SIDS, there are many factors that can put a baby at risk for it. This project explores many major causes of SIDS and there are many factors that can put a baby at risk for it. The project explores three major causes of SIDS: suffocation from an infant rolling over onto its stomach, overheating, and respiratory infection. Programming for each of these modes will be uploaded to the Circuit Playground: a single board microcontroller containing features such as an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, an alarm, and buttons. An application is also created to alert parents if any of these causes are met. 

This code is in javascript and can be run in the makecode simulation but the final disign will be in CircuitPython
